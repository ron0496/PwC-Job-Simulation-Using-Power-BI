#### Insights
1.	Out of all the 7043 customers, 26.54 i.e overall 27 % of the customers churned last month.
2.	Customers having short tenure are more frequently switching than customers having longer tenure.
3.	If no Tech Support, Device Protection, Online Backup and Online Security are provided then the chances of customers churning are high.
4.	Payment method like Electronic check also makes a significant impact on the churning decision.
5.	There is no relation between gender with churning.
6.	Senior citizens are less likely to churn rate.
7.	Customers with any dependents or partners are churning less likely, whereas the non-dependents and non-partners customers are more likely to shift.
8.	Tenure and contract play an important role in determining whether the customer will churn. Customers with monthly contracts i.e. lower tenure will switch frequently.
9.	Customers with Fiber Optic internet service will churn more compared to DSL internet service holders.

#### Recommendation
1.	Increasing the basic contract plan from 1 month to 3 months or 6 months can be a good starting point. This will help customers to be with us for a longer tenure.
2.	Starting special offers or schemes for customers who are single and have no family responsibility. They can become a permanent customer of the company. 'Catch them Young' is key to success here.
3.	Provide some offers to the senior citizens as they are stable customers like overall offer some discounts on long tenure plans.
4.	Offering basic services like device protection, tech support, and online security should be the primary goal. This will help the customer stay longer with the brand.
